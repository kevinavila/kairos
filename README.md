-Navigation Hierarchy (Year, Month, Day)

-Calendar (about halfway complete)

Deviations:
I have not fully completed the calendar navigation mechanism, but the layout is there. The month view is almost done, and date selection works. The year view has yet to be implemented. I ran into unexpected issues with upgrading Xcode/Swift which slowed the process. My laptop is very low on disk space as well and has made the process of developing in Xcode extremely slow. Nonetheless, the calendar will be fully functional by the Beta release.
